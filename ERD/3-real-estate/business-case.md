Prepare an E-R diagram for a real estate firm that lists properties for sale. The following describes this organization:
●	The firm has a number of sales offices in several states. Attributes of the sales office include Office_Number and Location.
●	Each sales office is assigned one or more employees. Attributes of employees include Employee_ID  and Employee_Name. An employee must be assigned to only one sales office.
●	For each sales office, there is always one employee assigned to manage that office. 
●	The firm lists property for sale. Attributes of property include Property_ID and Location. Components of Location include Address, City, State, and Zip_Code.
●	Each property must be listed with one (and only one) of the sales offices. A sales office may have any number of properties listed, or may have no properties listed.
●	Each property may have zero or more owners. Attributes of owners are Owner_ID and Owner_Name. An owner may own one or more properties. The system stores the percent owned by each owner in each property.
